# Simple CRUD operation in Node.js with MongoDB and GraphQL.
A simple project contains two MongoDB collections client and project.

I have developed this project for only backend.If anyone want to extent and connect GraphQL with Reactjs or with any other Frontend Technologies then they can easily do this with any middleware. ApolloClient is quite popular for Reactjs.

## What You Need to run this project
============================================================================<br>
<b>Nodejs :</b>You need to download and install the node js setup and setup environment variable for running node.js server. (https://nodejs.org/en/) please use the given url to download the setup and please install the recommended version.<br>

<b>MongoDB Databse: </b> You need to download the MongoDB setup and set enviornment variable to start the mongodb server. (https://dl.mongodb.org/dl/win32/x86_64) please download as per your system requierments.


## How to run this code
============================================================================<br>
I am assuming that you have installed all the required setup for the project. <br>
step-1 : open your command prompt and type 'monogd' command to start Database server.<br>

step-2 : open command prompt and reach to your project folder and write node node app.js (In my case my main file name is app.js).<br>

step-3 : command prompt will show message that your server is running on . Your server is running on PORT 4000 (In my case i have setup and allocat PORT 4000 to project).

Hope it will work fine.<br>

when you will open localhost:4000/graphql then it will look like the below Image
